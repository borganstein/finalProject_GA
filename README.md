# Final Project
## Front End Web Development
#### for General Assembly
---

This is the final project for a General Assembly course. Using HTML, CSS and Javascript to create a flashcard site to Learn German.

I am bilingual in German (and obviously English) but living in Australia for the last 25 years means that I struggle with my German. This site, I hope will help me (and possible others) to learn some German. Also, just a fun way to play around with some basic HTML, CSS and JS.

If you have any tips, tricks or ways I can do something better please hit me up on my various social channels or here on Github. 

Cheers, 

Bjorn
